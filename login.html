<hr />

<p>So you want to login, hmm?</p>
<p>If you don't already have an account, you'll need to
 <a href="accountrequest.html">request one</a>.</p>

<p>Since jbovlaste is moving towards public testing, you can get <a
href="personal/listing.html">a listing of all user
accounts</a>. I'll be making accounts for people who I know are
interested in jbovlaste. Your password will be the same as your
username. If I havn't already made you an account, just use guest. You
can ask for one, too. Please don't use other people's. That wouldn't
be nice.</p>

<p>Please note that while I occasionally use IRC nicks or aliases for
jbovlaste usernames, with the production version I'll only assign
usernames which are a recognizable function of one's realname, for
easiest recognition by those who aren't "in the know" and such.</p>

<p>
<strong>The guest account is now locked.</strong>
A form to create your own accounts will be made eventually.  In the
meantime, please submit your request as a bug.

<p>We're trying to set a cookie in your browser, now. Please accept it,
as, otherwise I'm not going to think you're logged in after this page.</p>
<p>I promise to be really nice with the cookie. It is set to expire in
48 hours, and will only be relayed to exactly this host. The only thing
I'm tracking with it is your user ID, and the time of your login. Of
course, I have to encrypt so that you can't trick me into thinking you're
someone else. I will occasionally change the key I use to encrypt
cookies, so you might come back after a day or two and find that you
have to log back in. I'm sorry about that, but I take security very
seriously. (And so should you!)</p>
