<h3>Valsi Definition Voting</h3>

<p>Voting on valsi definitions is used to express a preference as to
which competing definition for a word is the 'best'. You can pick one
per language. It will be used it the generation of the exported 'final'
dictionaries, to decide which definition to provide.</p>

<h3>Natural Language Word Voting</h3>

<p>
    It is also important to declare, for each sense of a natural
    language word, which valsi definition that uses that word is most
    accurate. Therefore, you can vote on this subject.  You actually
    vote on the exact place which the natlang word corresponds to.  The
    places available (including the gloss word 'place') are all those
    places in the definition that use the natlang word in question as
    the gloss word.
</p>

<p>
    This allows you, for example, to vote that 'traveller' is a good
    gloss for place one of klama, as opposed to the gloss word, if there
    was a definition that used 'traveller' as the natlang word for both
    those cases.
</p>

<p>
    You are only allowed one vote per natlang word per language, and any
    previous vote will be silently deleted when you vote.
</p>

<p>
    Note that you cannot vote on a natural language word until a
    definition is entered that points to it.
