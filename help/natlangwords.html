<font size="+3">jbovlaste and natural language words</font>
<hr />

<dl>
 <dt>Why does jbovlaste need natural language words?</dt>
 <dd>Oversimplified, to produce the (for instance), Japanese to Lojban
 section of a dictionary. By uniquely identifying every natural
 language word, and linking definitions to those words, I can display
 what Lojban words correspond to a given meaning of a natural language
 word.</dd>

<br />

 <dt>When you say "meaning" of a natural language word, what are you
 talking about?</dt>

 <dd>The "meaning" separates <a href="http://smac.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/http_webster?isindex=homonym&method=exact">homonyms</a> (which are common in natural
 languages, but nonexistant in Lojban). For instance, the English word
 "box" is a homonym with some meanings of "to hit (someone)" and
 "container". So there are two records for "box" in jbovlaste, with
 two different IDs, and two different meanings, "to hit" and
 "container".</dd>

    <dt>
	Can natural language "words" actually be phrases (i.e. more than
	one word)?
    </dt>

    <dd>
	<em>Absolutely</em>.  This is often a good idea, in fact.  The
	second place of samru'e is clearly something like "process inputs".
	It would be hard to make a single english word out of that.
    </dd>

<br />

    <dt>
	What language should the meanings/senses of natural language words be in?
    </dt>
 
    <dd>
	The language the word itself is in.  The sense of a word
	<em>is</em> printed in the dictionary, and it would be very
	jarring to see English senses in a Russian To Lojban dictionary!
