<p>Unicode is Nice. This page is in Unicode. For example, if your web
browser is working properly and you have a good set of Unicode fonts,
then:</p>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>This is a couple of Tibetian characters:</td>
  <td>༃༻བྷ༒</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>This is the "Om" character, from the Devanagari script:</td>
  <td>ॐ</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>And here is a bit of Hiragana, with a Bengali character tossed right in the middle:</td>
   <td>ふるআぱい</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>If you didn't see a whole lot of weird squiggles, then there is a good
chance that either your web browser doesn't understand UTF-8, or you're
missing some fonts.</p>

<p>Christoph Singer has a page of
<a href="http://www.ccss.de/slovo/unifonts.htm">TrueType Unicode Fonts</a>
which you can download and install. If that doesn't help, consider trying the
<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> web browser, which is what is
being used to test this site during development. Mozilla and Internet
Explorer 6 also seem to work. More or less.</p>

<p>If you use Unix, or some variant thereof, and you'd like to edit Unicode
text on your computer, consider trying
<a href="http://www.yudit.org/">Yudit</a>, which has been used extensively
in the development of this site. If you know of a good Unicode text editor
for other platforms, please let
<a href="mailto:<% $m->base_comp->attr('admin_email') %>">the admins</a> know, so that
they can add it to this web page.</p>

<p>The Unicode Consortium provides
 <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/products.html">a list
 of Unicode-enabled software</a> which you may find helpful.</p>

<p>jbovlaste recognizes the allocations of the
<a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/">ConScript Unicode
Registry</a> within the Unicode Private Use Areas. It further encourages
the Unicode Consortium to act swiftly in approving ConScripts which
demonstrate an existing language community, such as the Tengwar and
Klingon scripts.</p>
