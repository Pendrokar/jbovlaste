<h3>List Of Valsi Definitions Or Votes Needed Files</h3>
<p>
This is a list of links to all the languages jbovlaste supports.  These
pages list all the valsi that have no definitions or votes in that
language.  Many of these pages are <em>very</em> large.
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>  If one of these files does not exist, simple go
vote for a valsi definition in that language, and it will be created
shortly thereafter.
