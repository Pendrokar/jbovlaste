The main interface presented will be that of the Terminology section of
the current Wiki. Semantically organized, etc, etc.

It would have the same markup as the current Wiki, except with something
like the following added:

{brivla:w1d} which would expand to:

''brivla'' selbri word x1 is a word expressing predicate relationship x2
among arguments x3 in language x4

or {brivla:1234}
selbri word, predicate relationship, predicate arguments, language

so that where we've currently got pages in the terminology section like:

Astronomy (''kesyske'')
* Cosmology (''mu'erkraske'')
* Stellar Evolution (''puvytarga'i'')
** Accretion Disk (''jajycukla'')
** Star (''tarci'')
** Red Giants (''xunre ke karda tarci'')

Instead, we can have:

{kesyske:g(w)}
* {mu'erkraske:g(w)}
* {puvytarga'i:g(w)}
** {jajycukla:g(w)}
** {tarci:g(w)}
** {xunre ke karda tarci:g(w)}

Where each little {..} grouping would expand to into the english gloss
(look up the selbri, go to the best guess, retrieve the value from the
gloss column), followed by the word itself, parenthesized. That glob
would link to a page about the word, which would allow you to view the
threaded comments that have appeared about it (reverse chronological),
as well as vote on which provided definition (for a given language) was
the best.

Every so often, as appropriate, something would crawl the recorded votes
and update the "best guess" definition for each selbri. From this page,
you could go on and look at the pages for each natural language word
recorded.

That page would allow you to vote on what selbri worked best as a
translation for it, as well as view the comments associated with it.
(Which would be there to sway your vote.)

If you tried to pull up the page for a selbri which doesn't yet exist,
then you'd get a page asking you to enter a new definition. (Presumably
that would be available by some other means, as well, but I'd make it
no fun to find, so as to encourage people not to add definitions for
words without linking to them via the semantic organization.)
